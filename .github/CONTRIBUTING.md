# Bug Reports

To file a valid bug report, you should make sure your issue follows these conditions:

  - **The title should be clear and describe the issue concisely.** Further clarifications 
    should be made to the issue in the body rather than the title.
  - **The structure of the bug report should be as follows:**
    - *What is the expected behaviour of the library?*
    - *What is the observed behaviour of the library?*
    - *What steps can be taken to reproduce the issue?*
    - *Which version of the library are you using (if bleeding-edge, reference a commit hash)?*
    - *Provide a stack trace, if applicable.*
  - **If this issue is in a release version, has the problem been fixed in a later commit?** If you
    find that a later commit has fixed this issue, you should not create an issue.

# Feature Requests

To create a feature request, you should make sure your issue follows these conditions:
 
  - **The title should describe the new feature concisely.** There doesn't need to be any extra
    junk, further details should be clarified in the issue body.
  - **The structure of the feature request should be as follows:**
    - *What feature would you like to see in the library?*
	- *Why do you feel this feature is a valuable addition?*
	- *Is the feature an extension of a currently existing functionality?*
	- *Have you attempted to add this feature yourself (if so, provide a code example)?*
	
# Pull Requests

To create a pull request, you should follow this format:

  - **The title should concisely describe the added features or bug fixes in place.** Make sure the
    title is not cluttered, I will read the body of the PR if I am unclear on the changes.
  - **Each commit should have a clear summary of the changes.** I would like to be able to quickly
    see what changed have been made and where.
